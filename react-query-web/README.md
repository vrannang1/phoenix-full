> ### React + React Query codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://react-query-realworld.netlify.app)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React + React Query** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview) community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

```bash
src
├─ App.tsx
├─ index.tsx
├─ react-app-env.d.ts
├─ Router.tsx # dynamic router assignment
├─ components # components
├─ constants # constants
├─ contexts # context API
├─ lib
│  ├─ routerMeta.ts # meta data of router
│  ├─ token.ts # localstorage class
│  ├─ utils # utility funcs
│  └─ hooks # custom hooks
├─ pages # page components
├─ queries # react query func
└─ repositories # api service
    └─ apiClient.ts # Axios Instance & Interceptor
```

### Making requests to the backend API

For convenience, we have a live API server running at https://conduit.productionready.io/api for the application to make requests against. You can view [the API spec here](https://api.realworld.io/api-docs/) which contains all routes & responses for the server.

The source code for the backend server (available for Node, Rails and Django) can be found in the [main RealWorld repo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld).

### Using Marked Up Templates

You can check the marked up [frontend spec here](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/frontend-specs/templates).

# Getting Started

#### Install
```
npm i
```
#### Build
```
npm run build
```
#### Start
```
npm start
```

# Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called "Conduit". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can view a live demo over at [https://react-query-realworld.netlify.app](https://react-query-realworld.netlify.app)

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU- users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR-D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

**The general page breakdown looks like this:**

- Home page (URL: /#/ )
  - List of tags
  - List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag
  - Pagination for list of articles
- Sign in/Sign up pages (URL: /#/login, /#/register )
  - Uses JWT (store the token in localStorage)
  - Authentication can be easily switched to session/cookie based
- Settings page (URL: /#/settings )
  - Editor page to create/edit articles (URL: /#/editor, /#/editor/article-slug-here )
- Article page (URL: /#/article/article-slug-here )
  - Delete article button (only shown to article's author)
  - Render markdown from server client side
  - Comments section at bottom of page
  - Delete comment button (only shown to comment's author)
- Profile page (URL: /#/profile/:username, /#/profile/:username/favorites )
  - Show basic user info
  - List of articles populated from author's created articles or author's favorited articles
